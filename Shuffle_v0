/*
time([v]) -- REAPER 4.60+
Returns the current time as seconds since January 1, 1970. 1 second granularity. If a parameter is specified, it will be set to the timestamp.

time_precise([v]) -- REAPER 4.60+
Returns a system-specific timestamp in seconds. Granularity is system-defined, but generally much less than 1 millisecond. Useful for benchmarking. If a parameter is specified, it will be set to the timestamp.
